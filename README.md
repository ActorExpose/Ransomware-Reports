This repository serves as an archive of publicly available reports related to Ransomware. This might be useful for researchers as a reference as I didn't find a central repository containing these reports.

This repo is inspired from [threat-INTel](https://github.com/fdiskyou/threat-INTel) and [APTnotes](https://github.com/kbandla/APTnotes).
